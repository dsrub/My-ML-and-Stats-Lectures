#### These are some of my notes for various stats and ML lectures.  The stats lectures are a bit more introductory and the ML lectures are a bit more advanced.  Some of the ML lectures contain lab components in Jupyter notebooks, on what I thought would be most interesting/relevant for that topic.  I particularly like the [eigenface lab](https://github.com/dsrub/My-ML-and-Stats-Lectures/blob/master/advanced_ML_lectures/PCA/eigenface_lab.ipynb).
